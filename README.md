# 📊 Personal Dashboard (Vanilla JS + Responsive Design)

## 🎯 Goals
- Practice **HTML5 + CSS3** (flex/grid, semantic markup).
- Build **responsive design** (mobile-first, breakpoints).
- Use **Vanilla JS** for interactivity (DOM, events, localStorage, fetch).
- Keep dependencies minimal (only fonts/icons if needed).

---

## 📑 Features (MVP)
1. **Main Panel**
   - User greeting (e.g., “Welcome, Sardar!”).
   - Current date & time (refresh every second).
   - Light/Dark theme toggle (CSS variables + localStorage).
   
2. **To-Do Widget**
   - Add tasks.
   - Mark tasks as done.
   - Delete tasks.
   - Save to `localStorage`.

3. **Weather Widget**
   - Fetch data from API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
   - Show temperature + weather icon.
   - City selection.

4. **Currency Rates Widget**
   - Fetch exchange rates (e.g., exchangerate.host).
   - Show USD/EUR → KGS (or another currency).
   - Auto-refresh every N minutes.

5. **Responsive Layout**
   - 📱 Mobile: single column (widgets stacked vertically).
   - 💻 Desktop: grid with 2–3 columns.
   - Minimal media queries (e.g., `@media (max-width: 768px)`).

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **HTML5 + CSS3** (Grid/Flexbox, variables, media queries, animations).
- **Vanilla JS (ES6)**: DOM API, fetch, localStorage.
- (Optional) **SCSS** for cleaner styling.

## 📷 Visual Style
The dashboard will look like a simple iGoogle-style board:  
a set of cards (widgets) that adapt to screen size.
